⏺ Created /workflow. This is the master command — it runs the full pipeline:

PLAN → SCAFFOLD → BUILD → TEST → REVIEW → AUDIT → PUSH

Key design decisions:

- Hard gates — can't proceed to BUILD until the plan is approved, can't PUSH if there are blockers
- Skippable stages — tiny fixes skip PLAN/SCAFFOLD/TEST, bug fixes skip SCAFFOLD
- Session tracking — shows a running checklist so you always know where you are
- Self-contained — doesn't call other slash commands, it IS the pipeline (avoids confusion with duplicate /plan etc.)

Final suite — 11 commands:

┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┐

You can either run /workflow for the full pipeline, or run individual commands when you just need one step. Ready to push these and start Phase 1?

I'll make a phase_1_plan.md and then you can update that plan accordingly based on what you have done in that plan, how will you differ that from  
 logs.md?

⏺ Good question. Here's the split:

phases/phase_1_plan.md — The what and status

- Checklist of every task in the phase
- Check marks as features get completed
- Which step of the pipeline each feature is at
- Blockers, decisions made, scope changes
- The living tracker you look at to know "where are we"

docs/logs.md — The how and why

- Every action taken, with teaching notes
- Commands run, errors hit, fixes applied
- What was learned (Laravel patterns, gotchas)
- The history a future session reads to pick up context

Think of it as: plan = project manager's board, logs = engineer's notebook.

You create the phase_1_plan.md, I'll update it as I complete tasks and keep logging the detail in logs.md. They reference each other but don't duplicate.

❯ I'll name it Phase 1

⏺ Got it. phases/phase1.md — you create it, I'll update it as I work through the pipeline.

---

Manual Test Checklist — Feature 3: Body Maps

0. Setup

- Start server: php -d error_reporting=0 artisan serve
- Login as komal / 123456 (admin user, home_id 1)
- Direct URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/service/body-map/7

1. Body Map Page Loads

- Go to /service/body-map/7
- You should see a full-body SVG diagram (front view + back view) with male and
  female outlines
- Existing injuries (25 records from 2018) should show as red highlighted regions
  on the body
- Back button (yellow arrow, top left) should link back to the service user profile

2. View Existing Injury Info

- Click on any red (active) body part
- "Injury Information" modal should open
- Should show a table with: Body Region, Type, Description, Date Discovered, Size,
  Colour, Recorded By, Date Recorded
- Old injuries (2018 data) will show "Not specified" / "None" for the new detail
  fields — that's expected
- Close the modal with the X or Close button

3. Add a New Injury

- Click on any empty (non-red) body part (e.g. a hand, a knee)
- "Injury Details" modal should open with a form
- Fill in:
    - Type: Select "Bruise" from dropdown
    - Description: "Small bruise on left knee from fall"
    - Date Discovered: Today's date (should be pre-filled)
    - Size: "2cm x 3cm"
    - Colour: "Purple"
- Click Save Injury
- Modal should close, the body part you clicked should now turn red
- Click that same red part again — info modal should show all the details you just
  entered

4. Add Injury Without Details (Minimum Fields)

- Click another empty body part
- Leave all fields blank (type, description, size, colour all optional)
- Click Save Injury
- Should succeed — the body part turns red
- Click it to view — should show "Not specified" / "None" for the empty fields

5. Add Injury With Each Type

- Test each injury type from the dropdown works:
    - Bruise, Wound, Rash, Burn, Swelling, Pressure Sore, Other
- Each should save successfully

6. Remove an Injury (Admin Only)

- Click a red body part (one you just added)
- Info modal opens — you should see a red "Remove Injury" button (bottom left of
  modal)
- Click it — confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to remove this injury?"
- Click OK — modal closes, body part goes back to empty (non-red)
- Refresh the page — the body part should still be empty (soft-deleted in DB)

7. Non-Admin Cannot Remove

- Login as a non-admin user (e.g. find a user with user_type = 'N' for home_id 1)
- Go to /service/body-map/7
- Click a red body part — info modal should open
- The "Remove Injury" button should NOT be visible — only a "Close" button
- If you somehow send the POST request (via dev tools), it should return 403

8. CSRF Protection

- Open browser Developer Tools → Network tab
- Click an empty body part, fill in details, click Save
- In the Network tab, find the POST request to /service/body-map/injury/add
- Check Request Headers — should include X-CSRF-TOKEN header
- Check Response — should be JSON: {"success": true, "id": ..., "message": "Injury
  point added."}

9. Multi-tenancy Check

- Try visiting /service/body-map/999999 (non-existent risk)
- Should redirect back (risk assessment not found)
- If you have a risk_id from a different home, try that too — should also redirect

10. Back Body Parts Work

- Scroll down on the body map — there's a back view of the body (body parts with
  bck\_ IDs)
- Click an empty back body part — injury detail modal should open
- Save an injury — back body part should turn red
- Click it again — info modal should show details
- Same add/remove flow as front body parts

11. History Endpoint (Dev Tools)

- Open browser dev tools → Console tab
- Run:
  fetch('/service/body-map/history/1').then(r=>r.json()).then(d=>console.log(d))
- Should return JSON with success: true and a data array containing all injuries
  (active + removed) for service_user_id 1
- Removed injuries should have is_deleted: "1"

12. Page Refresh Persistence

- Add 2-3 injuries on different body parts
- Refresh the page (F5)
- All the injuries you added should still be red (loaded from DB)
- Click each to verify the details persisted

13. Reaching Body Map Through the UI

- Go to a service user profile (try /service/user-profile/1)
- Find the Risk Assessment section
- Click the body map icon (human figure) next to a risk entry
- Should open the body map (either as a modal popup or full page depending on the
  view)

/careos-workflow Handover Notes — Feature 4 from Phase 1.

Details from phases/phase1.md:

What Exists:

- DB table: handover_log_book
- Model: NO dedicated model (uses raw DB)
- Controller: app/Http/Controllers/frontEnd/HandoverController.php — index() with search/date filtering, handover_log_edit()
- Routes: POST/GET /handover/daily/log, POST/GET /handover/daily/log/edit, POST /handover/service/log
- Views: resources/views/frontEnd/common/handover_logbook.blade.php, resources/views/frontEnd/serviceUserManagement/elements/handover_to_staff.blade.php

What's Missing (Build These):

- Create model: app/Models/HandoverLogBook.php with proper fillable, casts, relationships
- Create service: app/Services/HandoverService.php — move DB logic out of controller
- Verify/fix list view — ensure existing blade works, date order, search works
- Verify/fix create/edit form — shift info, key events, client updates, follow-up actions, priority flags
- Add staff-to-staff handover flow — outgoing shift writes notes, incoming shift acknowledges
- Server-side validation on all form inputs

Note: No CareRoster export exists — build from existing Laravel implementation and care home best practices.

⏺ Found it — CLAUDE.md's stated credentials (admin / 123456) are wrong. No user named "admin" exists in the user table. The real working account from past
sessions is komal, which was explicitly set up in Session 6 with access to Aries House (home id 8) and password reset to 123456.

Try this login

- Company Name: omega care group
- Home: Aries House
- Username: komal
- Password: 123456

This is the account that was fully set up for testing in Session 6 — her access_rights were extended to 621 (covering all roster permissions) and her
password reset to 123456. She has admin role (user_type=A) and access to home 8 (Aries House) among others.

The admin/123456 in CLAUDE.md refers to the admin table (super-admin / company owner), but the frontend login route only checks the user table, so that
record can't sign in through this form.

Want me to fix CLAUDE.md afterward to say komal / 123456 + Aries House?

⏺ Generic Chrome warning — not concerning for your dev work.

That's Google Password Manager's "Password Checkup" feature. It cross-references passwords you save against a database of known leaked credentials from
public breaches (haveibeenpwned-style).

Why it fired: 123456 is literally the most common leaked password in the world — it appears in essentially every breach dataset. Chrome sees you used it,
checks its list, finds it, and warns you.

It does NOT mean:

- Your Care OS database was breached
- Someone leaked Omega Life credentials
- There's a security issue with the application

It just means: you used a trivially weak password that happens to exist in public breach lists (because millions of people have used 123456).

What to do: Click OK / dismiss. Don't let Chrome change it for you — this is a local dev password for a test account, not a real credential. The warning
is irrelevant in this context.

Also — login clearly worked. You're on /roster, seeing the Welcome dashboard with Active Clients, Quick Actions, etc. Ready to start testing Features 1–3
whenever you want.

home_id varchar(255) NO NULL
… +24 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found it — two issues:

1. Risk id 7 belongs to home_id 1, not home 8 (Aries House). Since komal's first home in her comma-separated list is 8, the index() method's check
   where('home_id', $homeId) fails and triggers redirect()->back()->with('error', 'Risk assessment not found').

2. The 404 you're seeing is the "back" redirect falling through — when there's no Referer header (e.g., you typed the URL directly), Laravel's
   redirect()->back() lands somewhere that doesn't exist. The error flash message is being eaten.

What to do

Navigate to body maps the proper way — through the Service User profile, not by typing a URL. That ensures you land on a risk that belongs to your home.
Walk-through:

1. Go to Service Users list (from sidebar)
2. Pick a service user that belongs to Aries House — looking at the DB, service user id 27 has several risks in home 8 (ids 149, 184, 185, 186)
3. Open their profile → Risk Assessments → Body Map (the popup view)

Or, to hit the full-page body map view directly, use one of komal's valid risk IDs:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/roster/service/body-map/149
http://127.0.0.1:8000/roster/service/body-map/184

These should load because home_id=8 matches.

Separate issue worth flagging

The controller's getHomeId() takes only the first home_id from the comma list (explode(',', $homeIds)[0]). That means if komal's current-session home is
Aries House (8) but her list starts with a different home, the check would fail even for risks she legitimately has access to. This is a bug pattern —
the check should be "is $homeId IN the user's comma list" and should use the currently selected home from the session, not [0]. I'd flag this for the
Feature 4 audit or a follow-up security pass.

Want to try /roster/service/body-map/149 in the browser and confirm the view loads?

❯ how can i navigate to body map from the ui

Searched for 3 patterns (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found it. Body Map is only reachable via the Service User Profile → Risk Assessments flow, as a popup modal. Here's the path:

Navigation from the UI

1. Sidebar → Service Users (or click "Service Users" in the main nav)
2. Click a service user to open their profile page
3. Scroll to (or click the tab for) Risk Assessments
4. Click on any existing risk assessment row — this opens a popup with risk details
5. In the popup's action buttons row, click the Body Map button — it shows as a person icon (fa fa-male) labeled "Body Map"
6. A #bodyMapModal opens with the full front/back body diagram

The button is hidden until you've opened a specific risk, because it binds su_risk_id dynamically via jQuery (see risk.blade.php:801-808).

Which service user to test with

Service user id 27 in Aries House has 4 risk assessments with existing body map data (risk ids 149, 184, 185, 186) — you already have 25+ existing
injuries in the DB for testing.

What to verify once you're in

- Front/Back toggle — switch between front and back body views
- Click an empty body part — the injury detail modal should open, capture type/description/date/size/colour
- Click an existing active body part — info modal shows recorded details + (if admin) a remove button
- Save an injury — should appear active on the map without page reload
- Remove an injury (admin only) — confirmation + removal
- History endpoint — check /roster/service/body-map/history/27 if there's a history link

If you can't find a service user in Aries House through the UI, let me know and I'll look up one with an actual name so you can search for them.

⏺ Got it — in Care OS's terminology, "Clients" = Service Users. They're listed under each care type (Residential, Domiciliary, Supported Living, Day
Centre) because a service user is tied to the home type they live in.

Path to Body Map

1. Sidebar → Residential Care → Clients (Aries House is a residential home, so this is the right section)
2. Click any client row to open their profile
3. Inside the profile, look for a tab/section called Risk Assessments (might be labelled "Risk & RMP", "Risks", "SU Risk", or just a tab in the profile's
   tabbed interface)
4. Click an existing risk assessment — a popup opens with risk details
5. In that popup, click the Body Map button (person icon, fa fa-male)
6. The body map modal opens

Client to look for

Service user id 27 in Aries House has 4 risk assessments with 25+ existing injuries on the body map — perfect for testing. Let me get their name so you
can find them in the Clients list.

⏺ Good — 13 active clients in Aries House. Pick any of these from the Clients list; Alex Sheffield (id 180) is probably the most realistic-looking name.

But there's a catch: these active clients have no existing body map data (the 25+ injuries in the DB all belong to the deleted Katie). So when you open
their Body Map it'll be a blank canvas — which is actually fine for testing the "add new injury" flow.

Full test path

1. Sidebar → Residential Care → Clients
2. Find Alex Sheffield (or any name you recognize)
3. Open their profile
4. Navigate to Risk Assessments tab
5. If they have no risks → click Add Risk Assessment first, create one, save it
6. Open the risk → click the Body Map icon (person figure, fa fa-male)
7. Body Map modal opens → click any body part → injury detail form → save
8. Verify the body part turns active → click it again to see the info modal
9. As admin (komal is user_type=A), try the Remove button

Alternative

If navigating through Risk Assessments feels indirect, I can also un-delete Katie (UPDATE service_user SET is_deleted=0 WHERE id=27) so you get a service
user with 25+ pre-existing injuries to test the view/edit/remove flows without having to create data first. Want me to do that?

There are two parallel Client UIs in Care OS

┌──────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┐

 ├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤

├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Sidebar links to │ ❌ │ ✅ │
└──────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────┘

What this means

1. The sidebar's "Clients" link goes to the new UI, which has hardcoded placeholder content (you can see "General Risk Assessment" with "Substance  
   misuse" text — that's dummy data, not tied to the su_risk table)
2. The Body Map feature we built, hardened, and shipped (Feature 3) is not reachable from the sidebar navigation. It lives in the legacy profile view
3. All those uncommitted security fixes are technically correct and tested — but no user would ever reach them through the current nav
4. The new UI is a rebuild-in-progress that's overriding the legacy UI in the sidebar but hasn't had any backend wiring done yet

How to reach Body Map RIGHT NOW

Bypass the sidebar and type the legacy profile URL directly:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/roster/service/user-profile/180

That'll load Alex Sheffield in the old profile page, where Risk Assessments actually work and the Body Map popup is functional.

Phase 1 implication (important)

This changes the scope conversation. If the client_details.blade.php rebuild is the future direction, then every Phase 1 feature we've "completed" may  
 need to be re-wired into the new UI (Incident Management, Staff Training, Body Maps). That's potentially a lot of additional work that isn't in
phases/phase1.md.

Before we proceed with Feature 4 (Handover Notes), I think we need to answer:

1. Is client_details.blade.php the future UI, or a side experiment?
2. If future: does Phase 1 need to include "wire features 1-3 into the new UI"?
3. If experiment: should the sidebar "Clients" link be pointed back at the legacy profile view so the hardened features are actually reachable?

This is a decision for you, not me. What do you know about how client_details.blade.php got there? Was it part of an earlier rebuild attempt, or did  
 someone on the team start it recently?

sessions is komal, which was explicitly set up in Session 6 with access to Aries House (home id 8) and password reset to 123456.

Try this login

- Company Name: omega care group
- Home: Aries House
- Username: komal
- Password: 123456

This is the account that was fully set up for testing in Session 6 — her access_rights were extended to 621 (covering all roster permissions) and her
password reset to 123456. She has admin role (user_type=A) and access to home 8 (Aries House) among others.

The admin/123456 in CLAUDE.md refers to the admin table (super-admin / company owner), but the frontend login route only checks the user table, so that
record can't sign in through this form.

Want me to fix CLAUDE.md afterward to say komal / 123456 + Aries House?

 ⎿ [Image #2]

⏺ Generic Chrome warning — not concerning for your dev work.

That's Google Password Manager's "Password Checkup" feature. It cross-references passwords you save against a database of known leaked credentials from
public breaches (haveibeenpwned-style).

Why it fired: 123456 is literally the most common leaked password in the world — it appears in essentially every breach dataset. Chrome sees you used it,
checks its list, finds it, and warns you.

It does NOT mean:

- Your Care OS database was breached
- Someone leaked Omega Life credentials
- There's a security issue with the application

It just means: you used a trivially weak password that happens to exist in public breach lists (because millions of people have used 123456).

What to do: Click OK / dismiss. Don't let Chrome change it for you — this is a local dev password for a test account, not a real credential. The warning
is irrelevant in this context.

Also — login clearly worked. You're on /roster, seeing the Welcome dashboard with Active Clients, Quick Actions, etc. Ready to start testing Features 1–3
whenever you want.

… +24 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found it — two issues:

1. Risk id 7 belongs to home_id 1, not home 8 (Aries House). Since komal's first home in her comma-separated list is 8, the index() method's check
   where('home_id', $homeId) fails and triggers redirect()->back()->with('error', 'Risk assessment not found').

2. The 404 you're seeing is the "back" redirect falling through — when there's no Referer header (e.g., you typed the URL directly), Laravel's
   redirect()->back() lands somewhere that doesn't exist. The error flash message is being eaten.

What to do

Navigate to body maps the proper way — through the Service User profile, not by typing a URL. That ensures you land on a risk that belongs to your home.
Walk-through:

1. Go to Service Users list (from sidebar)
2. Pick a service user that belongs to Aries House — looking at the DB, service user id 27 has several risks in home 8 (ids 149, 184, 185, 186)
3. Open their profile → Risk Assessments → Body Map (the popup view)

Or, to hit the full-page body map view directly, use one of komal's valid risk IDs:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/roster/service/body-map/149
http://127.0.0.1:8000/roster/service/body-map/184

These should load because home_id=8 matches.

Separate issue worth flagging

The controller's getHomeId() takes only the first home_id from the comma list (explode(',', $homeIds)[0]). That means if komal's current-session home is
Aries House (8) but her list starts with a different home, the check would fail even for risks she legitimately has access to. This is a bug pattern —
the check should be "is $homeId IN the user's comma list" and should use the currently selected home from the session, not [0]. I'd flag this for the
Feature 4 audit or a follow-up security pass.

Want to try /roster/service/body-map/149 in the browser and confirm the view loads?

❯ how can i navigate to body map from the ui

Searched for 3 patterns (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found it. Body Map is only reachable via the Service User Profile → Risk Assessments flow, as a popup modal. Here's the path:

Navigation from the UI

1. Sidebar → Service Users (or click "Service Users" in the main nav)
2. Click a service user to open their profile page
3. Scroll to (or click the tab for) Risk Assessments
4. Click on any existing risk assessment row — this opens a popup with risk details
5. In the popup's action buttons row, click the Body Map button — it shows as a person icon (fa fa-male) labeled "Body Map"
6. A #bodyMapModal opens with the full front/back body diagram

The button is hidden until you've opened a specific risk, because it binds su_risk_id dynamically via jQuery (see risk.blade.php:801-808).

Which service user to test with

Service user id 27 in Aries House has 4 risk assessments with existing body map data (risk ids 149, 184, 185, 186) — you already have 25+ existing
injuries in the DB for testing.

What to verify once you're in

- Front/Back toggle — switch between front and back body views
- Click an empty body part — the injury detail modal should open, capture type/description/date/size/colour
- Click an existing active body part — info modal shows recorded details + (if admin) a remove button
- Save an injury — should appear active on the map without page reload
- Remove an injury (admin only) — confirmation + removal
- History endpoint — check /roster/service/body-map/history/27 if there's a history link

If you can't find a service user in Aries House through the UI, let me know and I'll look up one with an actual name so you can search for them.

⏺ Got it — in Care OS's terminology, "Clients" = Service Users. They're listed under each care type (Residential, Domiciliary, Supported Living, Day
Centre) because a service user is tied to the home type they live in.

Path to Body Map

1. Sidebar → Residential Care → Clients (Aries House is a residential home, so this is the right section)
2. Click any client row to open their profile
3. Inside the profile, look for a tab/section called Risk Assessments (might be labelled "Risk & RMP", "Risks", "SU Risk", or just a tab in the profile's
   tabbed interface)
4. Click an existing risk assessment — a popup opens with risk details
5. In that popup, click the Body Map button (person icon, fa fa-male)
6. The body map modal opens

Client to look for

Service user id 27 in Aries House has 4 risk assessments with 25+ existing injuries on the body map — perfect for testing. Let me get their name so you
can find them in the Clients list.

⏺ Good — 13 active clients in Aries House. Pick any of these from the Clients list; Alex Sheffield (id 180) is probably the most realistic-looking name.

But there's a catch: these active clients have no existing body map data (the 25+ injuries in the DB all belong to the deleted Katie). So when you open
their Body Map it'll be a blank canvas — which is actually fine for testing the "add new injury" flow.

Full test path

1. Sidebar → Residential Care → Clients
2. Find Alex Sheffield (or any name you recognize)
3. Open their profile
4. Navigate to Risk Assessments tab
5. If they have no risks → click Add Risk Assessment first, create one, save it
6. Open the risk → click the Body Map icon (person figure, fa fa-male)
7. Body Map modal opens → click any body part → injury detail form → save
8. Verify the body part turns active → click it again to see the info modal
9. As admin (komal is user_type=A), try the Remove button

Alternative

If navigating through Risk Assessments feels indirect, I can also un-delete Katie (UPDATE service_user SET is_deleted=0 WHERE id=27) so you get a service
user with 25+ pre-existing injuries to test the view/edit/remove flows without having to create data first. Want me to do that?

What this means

1. The sidebar's "Clients" link goes to the new UI, which has hardcoded placeholder content (you can see "General Risk Assessment" with "Substance
   misuse" text — that's dummy data, not tied to the su_risk table)
2. The Body Map feature we built, hardened, and shipped (Feature 3) is not reachable from the sidebar navigation. It lives in the legacy profile view
3. All those uncommitted security fixes are technically correct and tested — but no user would ever reach them through the current nav
4. The new UI is a rebuild-in-progress that's overriding the legacy UI in the sidebar but hasn't had any backend wiring done yet

How to reach Body Map RIGHT NOW

Bypass the sidebar and type the legacy profile URL directly:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/roster/service/user-profile/180

That'll load Alex Sheffield in the old profile page, where Risk Assessments actually work and the Body Map popup is functional.

Phase 1 implication (important)

This changes the scope conversation. If the client_details.blade.php rebuild is the future direction, then every Phase 1 feature we've "completed" may
need to be re-wired into the new UI (Incident Management, Staff Training, Body Maps). That's potentially a lot of additional work that isn't in
phases/phase1.md.

Before we proceed with Feature 4 (Handover Notes), I think we need to answer:

1. Is client_details.blade.php the future UI, or a side experiment?
2. If future: does Phase 1 need to include "wire features 1-3 into the new UI"?
3. If experiment: should the sidebar "Clients" link be pointed back at the legacy profile view so the hardened features are actually reachable?

This is a decision for you, not me. What do you know about how client_details.blade.php got there? Was it part of an earlier rebuild attempt, or did
someone on the team start it recently?

 ⎿ roster group: line 137 to 252

⏺ Found my earlier mistake. The roster prefix group closes at line 252 — the legacy profile route (line 1047) and body-map routes (lines 1187-1192) are
outside it. So there is NO /roster/ prefix on those URLs. The correct URLs are:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/service/user-profile/180  
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/service/body-map/149

Try http://127.0.0.1:8000/service/user-profile/180 — that should load Alex Sheffield's legacy profile page (with the working Risk Assessments tab and  
 Body Map popup).

My earlier /roster/service/body-map/7 URL was wrong on two counts: wrong prefix AND wrong risk id. Sorry for the runaround.

 ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤

 └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘

So:

- The legacy page you're looking at now (Alex Sheffield profile) is the real, mature UI that has existed since the project's first commit in March 2024  
  and has been evolved ever since
- The new client-details page with the CareRoster-style tabs was added just 7 days ago, on 2026-04-08, in a single bulk commit that brought over "all  
  pending dev work" — presumably from another branch or environment
- That new page is effectively a scaffold/mockup with hardcoded data — no backend wiring for Risk Assessments, no Body Map integration, no real client
  data

What this means practically

1. The Body Map feature we built, hardened, and shipped is still live and reachable — it just lives on the legacy profile page at  
   /service/user-profile/{id}, not through the new sidebar
2. The new client-details page is not our work — someone else (or an earlier session of you) scaffolded it to match the CareRoster React app's look,  
   probably as part of the larger rebuild direction the project is heading in
3. The sidebar links were switched to point at the new page (also in the 2026-04-08 commit), which made the legacy page effectively invisible unless you
   know the URL

Decision point for you

Before Feature 4 (Handover Notes), you need to decide:

Option A — Stay on legacy UI

- Build Feature 4 onto the existing legacy profile/views (same pattern as Features 1–3)
- The new client-details page becomes dead code
- Fastest path to Phase 1 completion
- Fix sidebar to point back at legacy URLs

Option B — Migrate to new UI

- Decide the client-details rebuild is the direction, wire up Features 1–3 into it
- Build Feature 4 in the new UI pattern
- Significant extra work, changes Phase 1 scope
- Need to know what other pages the 2026-04-08 commit introduced

Option C — Two-track (not recommended)

- Build Feature 4 on legacy, deal with the new UI later
- Technical debt keeps growing

My recommendation: Option A, plus fix the sidebar. The legacy views are working, tested, and secured. The new UI appears to be aspirational scaffolding —
not production code. Unless you know there's a plan (and timeline) to fully rebuild the frontend in that new style, don't let it block shipping actual  
 functional features.

But this is your call — do you know the story behind the 2026-04-08 commit? Who added client_details.blade.php and why?

❯ tell mw where should i click for body map

Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found it. In the screenshot you shared, I can see the "Risk Log" button (it's visible as a small link near the top-right of the tile area, just below the
"This is working profile" text).

Click path

1. Click "Risk Log" — it takes you to /service/risks/180 → a list page of all risk assessments for this client
2. On the risk list, click any existing risk (or create one with "Add Risk" if the list is empty)
3. That opens the risk detail page with action buttons at the top
4. Look for the person icon (fa fa-male) labeled "Body Map" among the action buttons — it sits alongside "RMP" and "Report" buttons
5. Click it → the #bodyMapModal opens with the front/back body diagram

If Risk Log is empty

Alex Sheffield may have no risks yet. In that case:

- Create one via "Add Risk" first, save, then click it to open
- Or I can un-delete Katie (service_user_id=27) who already has 4 risks + 25 body map injuries ready to test

Which do you want to try first — click Risk Log for Alex Sheffield, or should I un-delete Katie so you have pre-existing data to test the  
 view/edit/remove flows?

⏺ Attach body maps to the risk assessment UI first — Feature 3 isn't truly "done" until users can actually reach it from the risk flow, and you  
 already have uncommitted changes on risk.blade.php and body_map_popup.blade.php that look like in-progress wiring. Finishing the integration now
keeps context fresh; starting Feature 4 (Handover Notes) on top of half-wired body maps means you'll come back to it cold later.

Phase 1 — 3/9 features done

Done: Incident Management, Staff Training, Body Maps (mostly)  
 Pending: Handover Notes, DoLS, MAR Sheets, SOS Alerts, Notifications, Safeguarding

Body Maps — loose ends from session 10 (all uncommitted)

1. Hover fix unverified — Vedang never confirmed the muscle3x.min.js .off() patch survived a hard refresh. Task #4 still open.
2. RiskController@view staff filter — sel_injury_parts still filtered by staff_id = Auth::user()->id, so injuries from other staff don't render in
   the risk view. This directly blocks "body maps attached to risk UI" from being truly usable across a team.
3. Standalone body_map.blade.php — PNG-background variant, no gender filter applied; unclear if it's reachable.
4. Pre-existing broken migration 2025_11_20_111238_add_is_completed_to_staff_task_allocation_table — blocks bulk php artisan migrate, worked  
   around with --path.
5. Katie's test gender set directly via SQL (UPDATE service_user SET gender='F' WHERE id=27) — not a bug, just a note.

Housekeeping

- Session 10 changes (9 modified files + new migration) are uncommitted on komal.
- phases/phase1.md pipeline table still says "1/9 done" — stale; CLAUDE.md says 3/9.
- .claude/commands/workflow.md deleted, replaced by careos-workflow.md (not yet staged).
- Sessions 7–10 untracked.

Recommended next moves

1. Finish verifying the hover fix and lift the staff_id filter in RiskController@view — that genuinely completes "body maps on risk UI."
2. Commit session 10 work in one go (migration + gender + colour persistence).
3. Update phases/phase1.md to reflect 3/9.
4. Then start Feature 4 — Handover Notes (next in recommended build order).

 via a modal), so carers can view injury history without opening a risk change.

My recommendation: finish the risk-popup integration first (fix the staff_id filter + verify hover), then surface a read-only Body Map section on
the profile page as the next step. Does that match what you had in mind, or were you thinking somewhere else (daily log, incident form, handover)?

 -l app/Http/Controll…)  
 ⎿ No syntax errors detected in app/Http/Controllers/frontEnd/ServiceUserManagement/RiskController.php  
 No syntax errors detected in app/Http/Controllers/frontEnd/ServiceUserManagement/BodyMapController.php  
 No syntax errors detected in routes/web.php

⏺ Bash(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8000/service/body-map/service-user/27/list)
⎿ 302

⏺ Route resolves (302 = login redirect, as expected for unauth curl).

⏺ All three tasks done. Here's what changed:

1. Risk UI fix — RiskController@view no longer filters body map injuries by staff_id, and moved the home_id check before the query. Every staff  
   member now sees every injury recorded on a risk, not just their own.

2. Hover fix verified — paintInjuryPath still has .off('mouseenter …') and window.paintInjuryPath is still exposed. Code-side good.

3. Profile page read-only body map —

- New endpoint GET /service/body-map/service-user/{id}/list → BodyMapController@listForServiceUser (home_id scoped, returns all active injuries
  for the service user via BodyMapService::listForServiceUser).
- Popup's shown.bs.modal now branches: bm_aggregated_su_id → aggregated mode, else su_rsk_id → risk mode. hidden.bs.modal resets state.
- Click handler skips add/remove flow when .bm-readonly is set; info modal still opens but remove button is hidden.
- profile.blade.php gets a new Body Map icon (fa-male) next to Calendar. Click sets the aggregated ID and opens the modal.

Files modified (6):

- app/Http/Controllers/frontEnd/ServiceUserManagement/RiskController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/frontEnd/ServiceUserManagement/BodyMapController.php
- routes/web.php
- resources/views/frontEnd/serviceUserManagement/elements/risk_change/body_map_popup.blade.php
- resources/views/frontEnd/serviceUserManagement/profile.blade.php

All three PHP files lint clean. The server is still running — please test in the browser:

1. Risk assessment page → open a risk with another staff's injuries → they should now render with the right colours.
2. Profile page → new body-map icon next to Calendar → click → modal shows all active injuries across risks, read-only (no add, no remove).

※ recap: Working on Phase 1 Feature 3 (Body Maps) — finished wiring body maps into the risk assessment UI and added a read-only body map icon on the
service user profile page. Next: test both in the browser to confirm they work end-to-end. (disable recaps in /config)

⏺ This is a different screen — /roster/client-details/27 is the new Care Roster mockup tab (hardcoded cards, the eye icon only toggles a mocked-up  
 second section). The working Risk Assessment UI we've been fixing is the older one at /service/risks/... with risk.blade.php, which is what
actually talks to the database and the body map.

Let me find the right URL to test against:

Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Two URLs to test:

1. Profile page (new Body Map icon): http://127.0.0.1:8000/service/user-profile/27 — click the fa-male icon next to Calendar → modal opens in  
   aggregated read-only mode showing all active injuries.
2. Risk assessment page (staff_id filter lifted): http://127.0.0.1:8000/service/risks/27 — click any risk row to open it → body map popup → should
   now show injuries recorded by any staff, not just the logged-in user.

The screenshot you shared is /roster/client-details/27, a different, half-built mockup that's not wired to the backend at all — its "eye" button  
 only flips between two hardcoded sections (line 8786 of client_details.blade.php), which is why nothing appears to happen.

Do you want me to wire the new /roster/client-details/{id} page up too, or is testing the working /service/user-profile/27 and /service/risks/27  
 URLs enough for now?

❯ tell me the ui path then, dont give me urls

⏺ From the sidebar on the left of the app:

Path 1 — Profile page body map icon (the new one I just added)  
 Residential Care → Clients → click a client's name → on their profile page, look at the top-right row of round icons (Calendar, File Manager,
Report, Logs…) → the new Body Map icon (male silhouette, fa-male) sits right next to the Calendar icon → click it → modal opens showing every  
 active injury for that client in read-only mode.

Path 2 — Risk assessment body map (the staff_id filter fix)  
 Residential Care → Clients → click a client's name → from the profile page, click the Risk Assessments area (the risk list/icon) → click any
existing risk row to open its detail → scroll to the Body Map section of the risk → injuries recorded by any staff should now render, not just  
 your own.

The screen in your screenshot (the tabbed "Client Details" page with Details / Onboarding / Care Tasks / Alerts / AI Insights / Care Plan / Risk  
 Assessments / Medication) is a different, half-built mockup screen — its Risk Assessments tab has hardcoded cards, and the eye button only toggles
between two dummy sections. It's not wired to the database, so nothing meaningful happens there. The working UI is the older profile/risk screens
reached via the Clients list in the sidebar.

 this, i dont see anything on top right , and neither is any risk clickable

⏺ I need to be straight with you — my integration is on the wrong screen.

What you're on (client-details page, Care Roster sidebar) is the new half-built mockup. Its Risk Assessments tab contains hardcoded cards; the eye
icon only toggles a dummy second section. Nothing there talks to the database, so no risk row is actually clickable in any meaningful sense.

The body map icon I added lives on the old Service User Management profile page (profile.blade.php), which is reached from the original SCITS  
 dashboard — not the Care Roster sidebar you have open. The Care Roster sidebar has no link that leads to it. That's why you don't see the icon and
don't see a working risk row.

So you have three options — tell me which one:

1. Test the old UI — I tell you how to switch out of the Care Roster sidebar into the original SCITS dashboard, where my work is live and  
   functional.
2. Move the work to the new UI — I rip out the Risk Assessments mock on client_details.blade.php and wire it to real data + real body map, like we
   did for the old profile page. Bigger job but aligns with the Care Roster rebuild direction.
3. Both — keep the old UI fix as a backstop, and also do the new UI.

Which way?

⏺ The error is just from the pre-existing OnboardingConfigurationController issue when I tried artisan route:list earlier — unrelated. Our page
returns 302 (auth redirect, expected).

⏺ All three tasks done. Here's what to test on the same screen you just showed me:

Path (Care Roster sidebar): Residential Care → Clients → pick a client → you'll land on client-details.

What's now wired:

1. Header row (next to Edit Client): a new Body Map button. Click it → modal opens in read-only aggregated mode showing every active injury for  
   that client across every risk.
2. Risk Assessments tab: the 6 hardcoded cards are gone. The tab now renders a @foreach of the client's real su_risk rows (title = risk  
   description, status badge from 1=historic / 2=live / 3=no risk, assessed date from created_at). Empty state: "No risk assessments recorded yet."
3. Body map icon on each real risk card: click it → modal opens in risk mode scoped to that su_risk_id, where you can add/remove injuries against
   that specific risk.
4. Security: client_details now does home_id scoping — 404s if you try to open a client from another home.

Files changed this round:

- app/Http/Controllers/frontEnd/Roster/Client/ClientController.php — home_id scoping, risks query, $patient + $service_user_id passed to view.
- resources/views/frontEnd/roster/client/client_details.blade.php — Body Map button in header, @foreach over real risks, popup include, click  
  handlers.

Hard-refresh the page (Cmd-Shift-R) and give it a go — Alex Sheffield at client id 180 should now have a working Body Map button and any real
risks he's got in su_risk will show up.

✻ Baked for 2m 46s · 1 shell still running

※ recap: Goal: integrate the body map into the new Care Roster client-details screen. Current task is done — controller wired to real risks, mocked
cards replaced, header Body Map button and per-risk buttons added. Next: hard-refresh the client-details page and test. (disable recaps in
/config)

Feature 4: Handover Notes — Manual Testing Checklist

Prerequisites

- Server running: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Login: komal / 123456 / house Aries

---

Part 1: Finding the Handover Feature

The handover logbook is accessed from the Logbook section of a service user. I need to first confirm where the modal gets included.

Searched for 3 patterns, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good. Now I know how to navigate. The "Hand Over" link is in the top-right dropdown menu (the user menu alongside Add User, General Admin, Lock,
Log Out). Let me also check the logbook flow for the "Add to Handover" button.

Feature 4: Handover Notes — Manual Testing Guide

Server: http://127.0.0.1:8000  
 Login: komal / 123456 / house Aries

There are two ways to access handover notes. Test both.

---

PATH A: View Handover Log Book (top menu)

Step 1: Open the Handover Log Book

1. Login and navigate to any page (e.g. Dashboard or Clients list)
2. Click the dropdown menu in the top-right corner (your user avatar/name)
3. You should see: Add User, Forms, General Admin, Lock, Hand Over, Log Out
4. Click "Hand Over"

What to check:

- A modal titled "Hand Over Log Book" opens
- It shows a "Logged" section with records grouped by date
- Each record shows: title, time, expand (+) button
- If no records exist, it should show "No Logs Found"

Step 2: Expand a record

1. Click the date header to expand records for that date
2. Click the green + icon on any record

What to check:

- The record expands showing: Details (textarea), Notes (textarea), Staff created (read-only), Handover Staff Name (read-only), Submit button
- An acknowledgment badge shows: either green "Acknowledged" or yellow "Pending" with a blue "Acknowledge" button

Step 3: Edit a record

1. Type something in the Details textarea
2. Type something in the Notes textarea
3. Click Submit

What to check:

- A green success message appears: "Record edited successfully"
- The message fades after ~5 seconds
- Close the modal, reopen Hand Over — your changes should persist

Step 4: Acknowledge a handover

1. Find a record with a yellow "Pending" badge
2. Click the blue "Acknowledge" button

What to check:

- Button changes to "Acknowledging..." and disables
- Badge changes from yellow "Pending" to green "Acknowledged"
- The Acknowledge button disappears
- Success message: "Handover acknowledged"
- Close and reopen — the record should still show "Acknowledged"

Step 5: Test search by title

1. In the Hand Over Log Book modal, find the Search section (if visible — there may be Logged/Search tabs)
2. Select type: Title
3. Type part of a record's title
4. Click Confirm

What to check:

- Results show only matching records
- "No records found" if nothing matches

Step 6: Test search by date

1. Change type to Date
2. Pick a date using the date picker
3. Click Confirm

What to check:

- Results filtered to that date
- Date picker opens and works correctly

---

PATH B: Handover from a Service User's Logbook

This is the flow where staff hand over a specific logbook entry to another staff member.

Step 7: Navigate to a service user's logbook

1. Go to Clients (sidebar) → click View Details on any client
2. On the client details page, find the Log Book section/tab
3. You should see logbook entries for that client

Step 8: Hand over a logbook entry

1. On a logbook entry, look for an "Add to Handover" option (it may be in a dropdown/action menu on the entry)
2. Click it

What to check:

- A modal titled "Handover to Staff User" opens
- It shows a Select Staff User dropdown
- The dropdown is populated with staff from Aries home only (not staff from other homes)

Step 9: Complete the handover

1. Select a staff member from the dropdown
2. Click Submit

What to check:

- Success message: "Log has been handovered to staff member successfully"
- If you try the same staff member again → "Log is already handovered to this staff member"

---

PATH C: Edge Cases & Security

Step 10: Empty state

1. If possible, find a home/context with no handover records
2. Open Hand Over from the top menu

What to check:

- Shows "No Logs Found" — not a blank page or error

Step 11: Special characters

1. Edit a handover record
2. In Details, type: <script>alert('test')</script> & "quotes" < > special chars
3. Submit, then close and reopen

What to check:

- The text appears exactly as typed (no alert popup!)
- Special characters display correctly, not as &amp; etc.

---

What to Report Back

For each step, note:

- PASS — works as described
- FAIL — describe what you saw instead
- BLOCKED — couldn't reach this step (describe why)
- MISSING — the UI element/button/tab doesn't exist on the page

The most critical things to verify:

1. Can you even find and open the Hand Over modal? (Step 1)
2. Do records load and display? (Step 2)
3. Does edit save and persist? (Step 3)
4. Does Acknowledge work? (Step 4)
5. Does the Handover to Staff flow work from a logbook entry? (Steps 7-9)

If Step 1 fails (modal doesn't open), everything else is blocked — report that immediately.

Total: 27 attack vectors, tested across 4 stages (TEST, REVIEW, AUDIT, PROD-READY).

The key shift: 14 of these are now verified by actually attacking via curl, not by reading code. The 3 vulnerabilities that slipped through in
Feature 4 (items 2, 3, 7) would all be caught now because REVIEW requires a failed exploit as proof, not a code pattern match.

2. Automated Testing (Stage 4 — 5 categories)

┌───────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
 │ Category │ What's tested │ Catches │
├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

3. Runtime Verification (Stage 5 — DEBUG)

┌────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
 │ Check │ How │ Catches │  
 ├────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

 ├────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Dead code │ No empty methods, no 5+ line comment blocks, no unused use │ Code bloat, confusion for next developer │
│ │ imports │ │  
 └────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. Adversarial Security (Stage 6 — REVIEW via curl)

This is the stage that was broken before. Now requires actual exploitation attempts against the running dev server:

┌──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
 │ Attack │ Method │ Pass criteria │
├──────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Cross-home record access │ curl with record ID from different home │ 404, not the data │
├──────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Cross-home FK injection │ curl create/update with FK from different home │ Rejected, not created │  
 ├──────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Cross-home source record │ curl create-from-X with source from different home │ Rejected │  
 ├──────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ CSRF bypass │ curl POST without \_token │ 419 │
├──────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

├──────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Mass assignment │ POST with home_id=999, is_deleted=1 │ Values ignored │
├──────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Client-side XSS trace │ Every .html() call traced to data source │ esc() or e() on every path │
└──────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

5. Codebase Health (Stage 7 — AUDIT via grep)

┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────┐  
 │ Pattern │ Grep command │ Expected │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────┤  
 │ Raw SQL │ DB::raw, whereRaw, selectRaw │ Zero in new files │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────┤
│ Unescaped Blade │ {!! │ Zero in new files │  
 ├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────┤

├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────┤  
 │ Hardcoded credentials │ API keys, passwords in code │ Zero │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────┘

6. Production Quality (Stage 8 — PROD-READY via curl + inspection)

This is the stage that was self-grading before. Now requires actual verification:

6a. Error & Edge Cases — verified via curl

┌────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
 │ Check │ How it's verified │ What broke before │
├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Empty state │ curl list endpoint with zero records → must show "No records found" │ Never tested — Feature 4 empty state │
│ │ message │ unverified │
├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Validation errors │ curl POST with missing fields → must return readable 422 errors │ Never tested with actual bad data │  
 ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Boundary values │ Submit 10,000-char string, & < > " ' chars → no 500, no layout break │ Never tested │  
 ├────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ AJAX error │ Read every $.ajax call → must have error: callback with user-visible │ Never checked — silent failures possible │  
 │ handling │ message │ │
└────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

6b. Performance — verified via code

┌──────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Check │ What │
├──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Eager loading │ List views with relations use ->with() │
├──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Database indexes │ WHERE/ORDER BY columns indexed, composites for multi-column queries │  
 ├──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Payload size │ ->select(...) used, not SELECT \* │  
 ├──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ No duplicate queries │ Same data not fetched twice per request │
└──────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

6c. UI Integration — verified by tracing includes

┌─────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
 │ Check │ How │ What broke before │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Blade @include │ Trace partial → parent page → verify jQuery, CSS, .loader │ Feature 4: never checked if parent page has the │
│ chain │ exist │ dependencies │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Form/modal behavior │ After submit: fields clear, modal closes, success shown │ Feature 4: 3 chained modals never browser-tested │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Destructive actions │ Delete has confirm() prompt │ Always checked │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Links │ All use {{ url('/path') }} │ Always checked │
└─────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

6d. Graceful Degradation — verified via curl

┌───────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐  
 │ Check │ How │ What broke before │
├───────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Null related data │ What if referenced staff member deleted? Controller has null check? │ New check — never caught │
├───────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Session timeout │ curl with expired session → clean redirect to login, not raw 419 │ New check — never caught │  
 └───────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘

6e. Manual Test Checklist — verified by user in browser

This is the new hard gate. Before PUSH, the workflow prints:

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗  
 ║ MANUAL TEST CHECKLIST — [Feature Name] ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣  
 ║ □ Navigate to [exact page] ║
║ □ Create a record → verify it appears ║  
 ║ □ Edit the record → verify changes persist ║  
 ║ □ Delete → verify it disappears ║  
 ║ □ Search/filter → verify results ║  
 ║ □ Empty state → verify message shows ║  
 ║ □ Special characters in input → no break ║  
 ║ □ Modal flow → all modals chain correctly ║  
 ║ ║  
 ║ Reply "tested" or report bugs. ║  
 ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PUSH is blocked until you confirm "tested". This catches the things I can't test — the Body Maps color persistence bug, the modal chaining, the  
 date picker initialization, the Select2 dropdowns. Those are browser-only issues.

Summary — What Changed vs Before

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Before (Features 1-4) │ Now (Feature 5+) │  
 ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tests hit single endpoints in isolation │ Tests verify multi-step flows + cross-entity IDOR │  
 ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ REVIEW read code and checked boxes │ REVIEW curls every endpoint with attack payloads │  
 ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ PROD-READY self-graded by reading code │ PROD-READY curls endpoints + traces @include chains │  
 ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Browser testing only happened when you manually found bugs │ Browser testing is a mandatory gate with a printed checklist │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ Security audit was a separate step you had to ask for │ Security is baked into REVIEW — no separate ask needed │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  
 │ "PASS" meant "the code looks right" │ "PASS" means "the attack failed" or "the curl returned what we expected" │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The workflow now produces production-ready code by default. You shouldn't need to ask "is this secure?" or "is this production ready?" again — if
it passes the pipeline, it's been attacked, verified, and browser-tested.
