## Current State Summary

Care OS has ~35% UI coverage and ~70% DB coverage for CareRoster features. Phase 1 targets 9 features that have backend pieces (tables, models, controllers) but lack usable frontends. The CareRoster Base44 React app is our **spec/reference only** — everything gets built in Laravel Blade.

**CareRoster source:** `/Users/vedangvaidya/Desktop/Omega Life/CareRoster/`
**CareRoster exports:** `/Users/vedangvaidya/Desktop/Omega Life/CareRoster/export/` (JSON + schema .md files)

---

## Testing & QA — 18h

### Manual E2E Testing (7h)
For each of the 9 features above:
- [ ] Create a new record → verify it saves to DB
- [ ] List records → verify all display correctly with pagination
- [ ] Edit a record → verify changes persist
- [ ] Delete/archive a record → verify soft delete works
- [ ] Check permissions — admin vs staff vs manager see appropriate data
- [ ] Check home_id scoping — users only see data from their assigned home(s)

### Cross-Browser Check (2h)
- [ ] Chrome (primary)
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge
- [ ] Check all forms submit correctly, tables render, modals open/close

### Mobile / Responsive Check (2h)
- [ ] All list views readable on mobile width (375px)
- [ ] All forms usable on tablet width (768px)
- [ ] Navigation menu works on mobile
- [ ] No horizontal scroll on any page

### DB Integrity Checks (2h)
- [ ] All new writes include `home_id` (multi-tenancy)
- [ ] All new writes include `user_id` (audit trail)
- [ ] SoftDeletes working — deleted records have `deleted_at` set, not physically removed
- [ ] No orphaned records (foreign keys valid)
- [ ] No N+1 queries on list views (check Laravel Debugbar or query log)

### Permission Checks (2h)
- [ ] Admin can see all homes' data
- [ ] Home manager sees only their home's data
- [ ] Staff sees only data relevant to them
- [ ] Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- [ ] All new routes have auth middleware

### Regression Testing (3h)
- [ ] Existing features still work: login, staff list, client list, rota/scheduling, daily logs, tasks
- [ ] No new errors in `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Navigation to all existing sections works

---

## Audit & Debug — 7h

### Laravel Log Review (1h)
- [ ] Clear `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- [ ] Use each feature, then check log for errors/warnings
- [ ] Fix any new exceptions

### Fix N+1 Queries (2h)
- [ ] Add `with()` eager loading on all new list views
- [ ] Check query count on each list page (aim for < 10 queries per page load)

### Validate All Form Inputs Server-Side (2h)
- [ ] Every form POST has a FormRequest or inline validation
- [ ] Required fields enforced
- [ ] Date fields validated as dates
- [ ] Enum fields validated against allowed values
- [ ] No raw user input used in queries (prevent SQL injection)
- [ ] XSS prevention — all user content displayed with `{{ }}` not `{!! !!}`

### File Upload Paths & Permissions (1h)
- [ ] Any file uploads go to `storage/app/public/` (not `public/` directly)
- [ ] Storage symlink exists: `php artisan storage:link`
- [ ] Uploaded files accessible via URL

### Remove Backup/Stub Files (1h)
- [ ] No `.bak`, `.old`, `Copy of` files in codebase
- [ ] No commented-out controller methods longer than 5 lines
- [ ] No empty/stub controllers or models left behind

---

## Buffer — 8h

Reserved for unexpected fixes, scope adjustments, and anything that takes longer than estimated.

---

## Process

For each feature, follow the `/workflow` pipeline:

1. **PLAN** — confirm scope, identify files to create/modify
2. **SCAFFOLD** — create models, migrations, form requests, routes
3. **BUILD** — implement controllers, services, blade views
4. **TEST** — manual E2E test the feature
5. **REVIEW** — code review for quality, security, consistency

After all 9 features are done:
6. **AUDIT** — full codebase audit (logs, N+1, validation, cleanup)
7. **PUSH** — commit and push to GitHub

---

## Feature Build Order (Recommended)

Start with the most complete features (quick wins) and work toward the ones needing the most new code:

1. **Incident Management** (3h) — 95% done, mostly verification
2. **Staff Training** (4h) — 80% done, has views, needs verification + service layer
3. **Body Maps** (3h) — 60% done, has views, needs model + fixes
4. **Handover Notes** (4h) — 60% done, has views, needs model + service
5. **DoLS** (4h) — 70% backend, needs all views
6. **MAR Sheets** (8h) — 70% backend, needs all views + schema expansion
7. **SOS Alerts** (2h) — 50% done, stubbed model, needs everything frontend
8. **Notifications** (5h) — 70% backend, needs generic system + UI
9. **Safeguarding** (6h) — needs new referral model + full UI

---

## Key Rules

- **Do not start new modules** — Phase 1 is finishing what exists
- **Do not build AI features** — defer to Phase 3
- **Do not build client/staff portals** — defer to Phase 2
- **Use existing patterns** — match the code style already in the codebase (controller structure, view layouts, route naming)
- **Every view must use the existing master layout** — `layouts.frontEnd.master` or `layouts.backEnd.master`
- **Log everything** — all actions go in `docs/logs.md` with teaching notes
- **Home-scoped** — all data must be filtered by `home_id` for multi-tenancy
- **SoftDeletes** — all models use soft deletes (already the convention)
